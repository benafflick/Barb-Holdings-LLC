# Property Management - Single Page (Next.js + Tailwind)

This is a minimal single-page Next.js project (App Router) styled with Tailwind CSS.
Primary color: `#2677A9`

## What is included
- Next.js app with `app/layout.jsx` and `app/page.jsx` (all sections in a single page)
- Tailwind CSS configured
- Placeholder images in `/public`
- Contact form configured to use Formspree (replace `https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id` with your form endpoint)

## How to run locally

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- Replace placeholder text, logos, and the Formspree form action with your actual data.
- This project is intentionally minimal — tweak Tailwind and components to match your brand.
